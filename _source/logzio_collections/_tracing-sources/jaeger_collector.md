## Introduction

Logz.io recommends that you use the OpenTelemetry collector to gather trace transaction data from your system. Because of its versatility, OpenTelemetry has been widely adopted as the industry standard: OpenTelemetry can be equipped with many additional functionalities (one of which is aggregated trace data). Beyond that, OpenTelemetry is the best solution going forward and is now production-ready.

However, if you already have Jaeger deployed in your local environment, Logz.io's trace exporter for Jaeger will let you quickly start sending your tracing data to Logz.io from different Application Performance Management/Monitoring (APM) agents, including Zipkin. 

Over time, should you decide to change to the OpenTelemetry collector, please feel free to explore the topic [_Ship traces with OpenTelemetry_](https://docs.logz.io/shipping/tracing-sources/opentelemetry) for the procedure to configure and deploy the OpenTelemetry collector. You can always return to the Jaeger Collector as a secondary option if you experience issues with the OpenTelemetry Collector. 

This topic explains how to install the Logz.io Jaeger Collector. 

For an overview of the process to send traces to Logz.io, see [Getting started with Logz.io Distributed Tracing](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/distributed-tracing/getting-started-tracing/). 


#### Deploy Jaeger Collector with Logz.io Exporter

The Logz.io integration builds on the Jaeger Collector base image and uses the gRPC plugin framework to enable communication between the Collector and Logz.io.

<div class="tasklist">

##### Create a Docker network
Run the following command to create a Docker network: 

```yaml
docker network create net-logzio
```

To enable communication between the collector and the agent, include the name of the network you create in this step (for example, `net-logzio`) in the config file for each component. 

##### Configure the Logz.io extension
Configure the Logz.io extension with shell variables or environment variables. 

The required ports are described [here. ](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/deployment/#collectors) 
You'll need to change to the version page for your deployment. 

```yaml
docker run -e ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<<TRACING-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>  # see parameter list below\
 --network=net-logzio \  ## This is the name of the network you created in step 1 above.
 --name=logzio-collector \ ## In the collector configuration, the --name attribute specifies the <<collector name>> used to run the collector. In this example, the <<collector-name>> is "logzio-collector". 
 -p 14268:14268 \
 -p 9411:9411 \
 -p 14267:14267 \
 -p 14269:14269 \
 -p 14250:14250 \
logzio/jaeger-logzio-collector:latest
```


The complete list of Logz.io collector parameters is presented below. 
In addition to these parameters, you can also use [Jaeger's collector parameters](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/cli/#jaeger-collector-grpc-plugin). 
You'll need to change to the version page for your deployment.

|GRPC_STORAGE_PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL| The lowest log level to send.  From lowest to highest, log levels are: **trace, debug, info, warn, error**.  Controls logging only for the Jaeger Logz.io Collector.  Does not affect Jaeger components.|DEFAULT: **warn** |
|COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT | If youâ€™re using a Zipkin implementation to create traces, set this optional environment variable to the HTTP port for the Zipkin collector service.| |
